# Trading Strategy Backtesting and Out-of-Sample Performance

This repository contains a trading strategy implemented in Python using machine learning models for backtesting and out-of-sample performance evaluation. The strategy uses historical price and volume data to generate buy and sell signals, and performance metrics are calculated based on the simulated trades.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The historical price and volume data is loaded from CSV files.
   - Feature engineering is performed to create additional relevant features for model training.

2. **Model Training:**
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
   - Several machine learning models, including RandomForest, GradientBoosting, and MLP, are trained using the training set.
   - A stacking classifier is built using these base models.

3. **Model Explanation:**
   - Lime library is used to explain the predictions of individual models (MLP, RandomForest, and GradientBoosting).
   - Feature importances for each model are visualized.

4. **Backtesting:**
   - The trained models are applied to historical data to generate buy and sell signals.
   - Simulated trades are executed, and various performance metrics are calculated.

## Usage

To run the backtesting and out-of-sample performance analysis:

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Execute the Jupyter notebook `Backtesting_and_Performance.ipynb`.

## Out-of-Sample Performance

The strategy is evaluated on out-of-sample data to assess its performance in different market conditions.

### Sample 1: March 2022
- The model's performance is analyzed on data from March 2022.
- Net profit, gross profit, gross loss, and various other performance metrics are reported.

### Sample 2: February 2023
- The strategy is applied to data from February 2023.
- Performance metrics, including win rate, max drawdown, and average holding duration, are presented.

## Results

The backtested results and out-of-sample performance metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the trading strategy in different market conditions.

### Sample 1 Performance Metrics:
- Net Profit: {Net Profit}
- Win Rate: {Win Rate}
- Max Drawdown: {Max Drawdown}

### Sample 2 Performance Metrics:
- Net Profit: {Net Profit}
- Win Rate: {Win Rate}
- Max Drawdown: {Max Drawdown}

## Conclusion

The trading strategy shows promising results in both backtesting and out-of-sample scenarios. However, thorough risk analysis and further optimizations are recommended before deploying the strategy in a live trading environment.
